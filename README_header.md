Code to monitor [limnology RSS feeds](limnopapers/journals.csv) and [tweet](https://twitter.com/limno_papers) new articles.

## Scope

The keywords and journal choices aim to focus on limnology (the study of inland waters). They are also meant to exclude related topics such as fisheries ecology, water resources engineering, estuarine/marine ecology, ecological genetics, and the study of specific "inland seas" like the North American Great Lakes. Feel free to weigh-in in the repository issues on scope recommendations! 

**Keywords are in a calibration period where _ignore_ keywords are being aggressively added. If a keyword excludes your paper, please reach out.**
