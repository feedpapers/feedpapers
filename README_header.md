Code to monitor [limnology RSS feeds](limnopapers/journals.csv) and [tweet](https://twitter.com/limno_papers) new articles.

## Scope

The keywords and journal choices reflect a focus on limnology (the study of inland waters). They are also meant to exclude related topics such as fisheries ecology, water resources engineering, estuarine/marine ecology, ecological genetics, and the study of specific "inland seas" like the North American Great Lakes.
