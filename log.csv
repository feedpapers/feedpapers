In seasonally ice‐covered lakes, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emission at ice‐off can account for a significant fraction of the annual budget. Yet knowledge of the mechanisms controlling below lake‐ice carbon (C) dynamics and subsequent CO2 and CH4 emissions at ice‐off is limited. To understand the control of below ice C dynamics, and C emissions in spring, we measured spatial variation in CO2, CH4, and dissolved inorganic and organic carbon from ice‐on to ice‐off, in a small boreal lake during a winter with sporadic melting events. Winter melt events were associated with decreased surface water DOC in the forest‐dominated basin and increased surface water CH4 in the mire‐dominated basin. At the whole‐lake scale, CH4 accumulated below ice throughout the winter, whereas CO2 accumulation was greatest in early winter. Mass‐balance estimates suggest that, in addition to the CO2 and CH4 accumulated during winter, external inputs of CO2 and CH4 and internal processing during ice‐melt could represent significant sources of C gas emissions during ice‐off. Moreover, internal processing of CO2 and CH4 worked in opposition, with production of CO2 and oxidation of CH4 dominating at ice‐off. These findings have important implications for how small boreal lakes will respond to warmer winters in the future; increased winter melt events will likely increase external inputs below ice and thus alter the extent and timing of CO2 and CH4 emissions to the atmosphere at ice‐off.",Carbon Dioxide and Methane Dynamics in a Small Boreal Lake During Winter and Spring Melt Events,2018-08-25 11:09:04

Worldwide, dams are a main threat reducing river ecological functioning and biodiversity by severely altering water temperature, flow, and sediment regimes up‐ and downstream. Sustainable dam management therefore has a key role in achieving ecological targets. Here, we present an analysis of the effects of reservoir dams and resulting regime shifts on community structure and function of lotic macroinvertebrates. Our study derived management options to improve ecological integrity of affected streams. To do this, we contrasted time series data for water temperature (15‐min intervals over one year), discharge (daily means over 10 yr), and records of deposited fine sediments against macroinvertebrate samples from pairs of river reaches downstream of dams and of comparable tributaries not affected by dams in the German low mountain range. We observed a decline in the density and diversity of disturbance‐sensitive macroinvertebrates (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) and a correlation between hydrologic metrics and macroinvertebrate deterioration downstream of the dams. Typical “rhithral” (flow‐adapted) species changed to “littoral” (flow‐avoiding) species below dams, thus indicating a hydrologic regime shift. Increased fine sediment accumulations and deficits of pebbles and small cobbles below dams indicated a severe habitat loss below dams. Additional comparison with undisturbed reference streams allowed us to derive management options that could mitigate the negative impact of hydrologic alterations and accumulations of fine sediments downstream of dams. These options are conditional on the season and in particular address the frequency and duration of low and high flow events.",Riverine regime shifts through reservoir dams reveal options for ecological management,2018-08-27 03:53:15

                  <p class=""a-plus-plus"">Animals transform and translocate nutrients at ecologically relevant rates, contributing to eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems by mobilizing otherwise unavailable nutrients. Yet we know little about how animal-mediated nutrient cycling compares with external abiotic nutrient sources over long periods (years–decades) and at multiple timescales. To address this, we conducted a 19-year study in a eutrophic reservoir examining nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) inputs from watershed streams versus excretion by an abundant fish (gizzard shad, <em class=""a-plus-plus"">Dorosoma cepedianum</em>) at weekly, monthly and seasonal timescales. Over the entire time period, watershed N and P loading was 33- and 3-fold greater than fish N and P excretion, respectively. However, fish N excretion exceeded watershed nutrient loading in 36% of weeks and 43% of months, and fish P excretion in 68% of weeks and 58% of months during the growing season. Fish excretion had lower temporal variability in both supply rate and N:P ratio than watershed loading. Fish excretion also supplied nutrients at a much lower molar N:P ratio than the watershed (mean of daily N:P supply ratios were 15 and 723, respectively). In eutrophic lakes with high fish biomass, fish excretion can strongly influence algal biomass and community composition. Eutrophication management efforts should consider removal of benthivorous fish, like gizzard shad, in addition to other watershed management practices to improve water quality. Future climate change will modulate the interplay between fish- and watershed-mediated nutrient dynamics by altering the geographic distribution of detritivorous fish and the frequency and severity of storm and drought events.</p>",The importance of nutrient supply by fish excretion and watershed streams to a eutrophic lake varies with temporal scale over 19 years,2018-08-28 00:00:00
