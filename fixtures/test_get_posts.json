The results showed that eutrophication caused by nutrient enrichment plays a role in three aspects: (1) nutrient concentrations controlled the CO2 variability on decadal scales; (2) peak pCO2 and CO2 fluxes occurred in river mouths due to large external nutrient loading inputs; and (3) eutrophication effects on CO2 varied among subzones, which was linked to external inputs and in\u2010lake primary production. Meanwhile, temperature controls the seasonal variation in CO2 by stimulating primary production, leading to significantly lower pCO2 and CO2 fluxes in warm seasons with algal blooms. Further analysis suggested that temperature effects varied spatially and temporally, high nutrient loading may confound the temperature effects via stimulating CO2 production. To our knowledge, this study presents the longest field measurements (24\u2009yr) of CO2 from such large and ice\u2010free freshwater lakes with monthly surveys, which may provide a powerful example to demonstrate that eutrophication and warming can shape CO2 variability from a temporal perspective.

The results showed that eutrophication caused by nutrient enrichment plays a role in three aspects: (1) nutrient concentrations controlled the CO<sub>2</sub> variability on decadal scales; (2) peak <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes occurred in river mouths due to large external nutrient loading inputs; and (3) eutrophication effects on CO<sub>2</sub> varied among subzones, which was linked to external inputs and in-lake primary production. Meanwhile, temperature controls the seasonal variation in CO<sub>2</sub> by stimulating primary production, leading to significantly lower <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes in warm seasons with algal blooms. Further analysis suggested that temperature effects varied spatially and temporally, high nutrient loading may confound the temperature effects via stimulating CO<sub>2</sub> production. To our knowledge, this study presents the longest field measurements (24\u2009yr) of CO<sub>2</sub> from such large and ice-free freshwater lakes with monthly surveys, which may provide a powerful example to demonstrate that eutrophication and warming can shape CO<sub>2</sub> variability from a temporal perspective. Future studies should focus on the interactive warming and eutrophication effects to accurately predict future CO<sub>2</sub> emission.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Qitao Xiao, \nHongtao Duan, \nBoqiang Qin, \nZhenghua Hu, \nMi Zhang, \nTianci Qi, \nXuhui Lee"}], "author": "Qitao Xiao, \nHongtao Duan, \nBoqiang Qin, \nZhenghua Hu, \nMi Zhang, \nTianci Qi, \nXuhui Lee", "author_detail": {"name": "Qitao Xiao, \nHongtao Duan, \nBoqiang Qin, \nZhenghua Hu, \nMi Zhang, \nTianci Qi, \nXuhui Lee"}, "tags": [{"term": "Article", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/lno.11998", "prism_publicationname": "Limnology and Oceanography", "prism_doi": "10.1002/lno.11998", "prism_url": "https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.11998?af=R", "prism_section": "Article"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.11997?af=R"}], "link": "https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.11997?af=R", "published": "Mon, 13 Dec 2021 04:32:13 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 12, 13, 12, 32, 13, 0, 347, 0], "updated": "2021-12-13T04:32:13-08:00", "updated_parsed": [2021, 12, 13, 12, 32, 13, 0, 347, 0], "source": {"href": "https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19395590?af=R", "title": "Wiley: Limnology and Oceanography: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "Sun, 12 Sep 2021 10:37:22 -0700", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "Sun, 12 Sep 2021 10:37:22 -0700", "id": "10.1002/lno.11997", "guidislink": false, "title": "Pelagic N2 fixation dominated by sediment diazotrophic communities in a shallow temperate estuary", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=19395590&type=etoc&feed=rss", "value": "Pelagic N2 fixation dominated by sediment diazotrophic communities in a shallow temperate estuary"}, "summary": "Limnology and Oceanography, EarlyView.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=19395590&type=etoc&feed=rss", "value": "Limnology and Oceanography, EarlyView."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=19395590&type=etoc&feed=rss", "value": "Abstract\nEstuaries receive substantial anthropogenic nitrogen loading and are mainly considered net nitrogen sinks.

C:N and SUVA<sub>254</sub> also differed markedly between spring (C:N\u2009~\u200928; SUVA<sub>254</sub>\u2009~\u20093.5\u00a0L\u2009mg C<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00a0m<sup>\u22121</sup>) and winter (C:N\u2009~\u200916; SUVA<sub>254</sub>\u2009~\u20092.2\u00a0L\u2009mg C<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00a0m<sup>\u22121</sup>). Average S<sub>275\u2013295</sub> values (~14\u201317\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>\u22123</sup>\u00a0nm<sup>\u22121</sup>) were not significantly different among seasons, but variability in S<sub>275\u2013295</sub> was much lower in spring. This was attributed to terrestrial runoff based on its relatively uniform composition during the spring freshet. Seasonal variations in lagoon DOM were broadly correlated with variations in salinity (i.e., lagoon water transitioned from largely fresh in spring to hypersaline in winter), but a mixing analysis revealed strong evidence of processing and net DOC generation in summer. We also found evidence of DOC processing and build-up under the ice over the winter. This baseline understanding of DOM seasonality in Arctic lagoons is essential for evaluating climate-linked impacts on Arctic coastal ecosystems and broader feedbacks associated with carbon cycling.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Craig T.

These findings are among the first reported cases of copepod ingestion in the laboratory on actively feeding mixoplankton, and they highlight the importance of considering the trophic mode of the protist and the response by various zooplanktonic predators when attempting to understand the functioning of marine planktonic food webs.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Claudia Traboni, \nAlbert Calbet, \nEnric Saiz"}], "author": "Claudia Traboni, \nAlbert Calbet, \nEnric Saiz", "author_detail": {"name": "Claudia Traboni, \nAlbert Calbet, \nEnric Saiz"}, "tags": [{"term": "Article", "scheme": null, "label": null}], "dc_identifier": "10.1002/lno.11948", "prism_publicationname": "Limnology and Oceanography", "prism_doi": "10.1002/lno.11948", "prism_url": "https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.11948?af=R", "prism_section": "Article", "prism_volume": "66", "prism_number": "12"}, {"links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.11969?af=R"}], "link": "https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.11969?af=R", "published": "Tue, 07 Dec 2021 02:53:00 -0800", "published_parsed": [2021, 12, 7, 10, 53, 0, 1, 341, 0], "updated": "2021-12-07T02:53:00-08:00", "updated_parsed": [2021, 12, 7, 10, 53, 0, 1, 341, 0], "source": {"href": "https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19395590?af=R", "title": "Wiley: Limnology and Oceanography: Table of Contents"}, "prism_coverdate": "Wed, 01 Dec 2021 00:00:00 -0800", "prism_coverdisplaydate": "Wed, 01 Dec 2021 00:00:00 -0800", "id": "10.1002/lno.11969", "guidislink": false, "title": "At the mercy of the winds: The seasonal dynamics of floating and stranded seaweeds at mid\u2010latitudes", "title_detail": {"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=19395590&type=etoc&feed=rss", "value": "At the mercy of the winds: The seasonal dynamics of floating and stranded seaweeds at mid\u2010latitudes"}, "summary": "Limnology and Oceanography, Volume 66, Issue 12, Page 4391-4402, December 2021.", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=19395590&type=etoc&feed=rss", "value": "Limnology and Oceanography, Volume 66, Issue 12, Page 4391-4402, December 2021."}, "content": [{"type": "text/plain", "language": null, "base": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=19395590&type=etoc&feed=rss", "value": "Abstract\nMany seaweed species are particularly important for passive marine dispersal, yet relatively little is known about their floating and stranding dynamics.

Body size is a master trait that impacts predation risk to both visual and nonvisual predators. Acoustic measurements from the autonomous Zooglider revealed size\u2010dependent DVM behaviors in the San Diego Trough. Dual frequency (200 and 1000\u2009kHz) backscatter, in conjunction with physical properties of the ambient water and optical imaging of zooplankton, were recorded during 12 Zooglider missions over 2\u00a0yr.

Main findings strongly suggest that (1) the timing of Mo\u00a0:\u00a0Ca peaks reflects the occurrence of silicon limitation and diatom aggregation periods, (2) the height of these peaks relates to the amplitude of the first spring diatom bloom, and (3) Li\u00a0:\u00a0Ca serves as a proxy for the temporal dynamics of diatom biovolume and of biogenic silica recycling at the sediment\u2013water interface.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Julien Th\u00e9bault, \nAur\u00e9lie Jolivet, \nMatthieu Waeles, \nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Tabouret, \nSophie Sabarot, \nChristophe P\u00e9cheyran, \nAude Leynaert, \nKlaus Peter Jochum, \nBernd R.

Accumulation of coral on disturbed reefs was 3.5 times greater than on undisturbed, <i>Turbinaria</i>-dominated reefs. Long-term persistence of the coral-invasible state was facilitated by high abundances of grazing herbivores that prevent the establishment of macroalgae, whereas persistence of the <i>Turbinaria</i>-dominated state reflected the scarcity of browsing herbivores that consume mature macroalgae. By revealing processes that foster bistability of coral and macroalgae states, our work helps explain the rich dynamical behavior exhibited by coral reef communities in Moorea and elsewhere.</p>"}], "authors": [{"name": "Russell J.

Yet, ecosystem metabolism and consumer allochthony are rarely considered together, despite possible interactions and potential for them to respond to the same lake characteristics. In this study, we compiled global datasets of lake gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and zooplankton allochthony to compare the strength and shape of relationships with physicochemical characteristics across a broad set of lakes.
